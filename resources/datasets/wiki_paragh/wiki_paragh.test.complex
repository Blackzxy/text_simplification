Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces . Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate , the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow . These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge : e.g. , the familiar phenomenon of a static ` shock ' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with nonconductive surfaces . This is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive surface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects to be observed .

Nonetheless , the book was well received , perhaps due to the previous success of Les MisÃ rables . Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel , L'Homme Qui Rit -LRB- The Man Who Laughs -RRB- , which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy . The word used in Guernsey to refer to squid -LRB- pieuvre , also sometimes applied to octopus -RRB- was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book . His last novel , Quatre-vingt-treize -LRB- Ninety-Three -RRB- , published in 1874 , dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided : the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution . From squid dishes and exhibitions , to squid hats and parties , Parisians became fascinated by these unusual sea creatures , which at the time were still considered by many to be mythical . Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey where he spent 15 years of exile , Hugo 's depiction of Man 's battle with the sea and the horrible creatures lurking beneath its depths spawned an unusual fad in Paris : Squids . However , the novel was not as successful as his previous efforts , and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and Ã mile Zola , whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work . Though Hugo 's popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication , many now consider Ninety-Three to be a work on par with Hugo 's better-known novels . Hugo turned away from social\/political issues in his next novel , Les Travailleurs de la Mer -LRB- Toilers of the Sea -RRB- , published in 1866 .

On the Atlantic coast , probability of landfalling hurricanes has doubled in the recent millennium compared to the one and a half millennia before . A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast . In fact , few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000 â `` 1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium ; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD , when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3 â `` 5 times . During the quiescent periods , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores Highâ '' controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillationâ '' was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean .

However , modern two-stroke designs , like the Vespa ET2 Injection utilise fuel-injection and are as clean as four-strokes . In theory , a four-stroke engine has to be larger than a two-stroke engine to produce an equivalent amount of power . Two-stroke engines are becoming less common in developed countries these days , mainly due to manufacturer reluctance to invest in reducing two-stroke emissions . Even though the simplest two-stroke engines have fewer moving parts , they could wear out faster than four-stroke engines . Large diesel two-stroke engines , as used in ships and locomotives , have always used fuel-injection and produce low emissions . One of the biggest internal combustion engines in the world , the WÃ rtsilÃ - Sulzer RTA96-C is a two-stroke ; it is bigger than most two-storey houses , has pistons nearly 1 metre in diameter and is one of the most efficient mobile engines in existence . A single-cylinder two-stroke engine produces power every crankshaft revolution , while a single-cylinder four-stroke engine produces power once every two revolutions . However fuel-injected two-strokes achieve better engine lubrication , also cooling and reliability should improve considerably Two-stroke engines are becoming less common in developed countries these days , mainly due to manufacturer reluctance to invest in reducing two-stroke emissions . There are two ways that an internal combustion piston engine can transform combustion into motive power : the two-stroke cycle and the four-stroke cycle . In theory , a four-stroke engine has to be larger than a two-stroke engine to produce an equivalent amount of power . Older designs of small two-stroke engines produced more pollution than four-stroke engines .

The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position . With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment , the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public . Deep economic recession dominated FitzGerald 's second term as well as his first . They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth . The Fianna FÃ il opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback . The measures proposed by FitzGerald 's Minister for Finance , Alan Dukes , were completely unacceptable to the Labor Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services . The harmonious relationship the Taoiseach developed with TÃ naiste Dick Spring successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years , despite tensions between other ministers , and enabled the Government to survive . Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks in order to reduce the public budget deficit . The pursuit of â fiscal rectitudeâ in order to reduce a high national debt required a firmer control of public spending than Labor found easy to accept .

In the event of a cylinder breach , an uncontrolled fall of the elevator might result . Because it is impossible to verify the system completely without a pressurized casing -LRB- as described below -RRB- , it is necessary to remove the piston to inspect it . Past problems with early hydraulic elevators meant those built prior to a code change in 1972 were subject to possible catastrophic failure . A device known as a rupture valve is often attached to the hydraulic inlet\/outlet of the piston and can be adjusted for a maximum flow rate . If a pipe or hose were to break -LRB- rupture -RRB- , the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid , thus stopping the piston and the car in the down direction . Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a `` life jacket . '' This is a device which , in the event of an excessive downward speed , clamps onto the cylinder and stops the car . The code had previously required only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders . The cost of removing the piston is such that it makes no economic sense to re-install the old cylinder ; therefore it is necessary to replace the cylinder and install a new piston .
