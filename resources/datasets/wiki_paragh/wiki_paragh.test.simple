Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces . Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate , the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow . These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge : e.g. , the familiar phenomenon of a static ` shock ' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with nonconductive surfaces . This is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive surface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects to be observed .

Nonetheless , the book was well received , perhaps due to the previous success of Les MisÃ rables . Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel , L'Homme Qui Rit -LRB- The Man Who Laughs -RRB- , which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy . The word used in Guernsey to refer to squid -LRB- pieuvre , also sometimes applied to octopus -RRB- was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book . His last novel , Quatre-vingt-treize -LRB- Ninety-Three -RRB- , published in 1874 , dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided : the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution . From squid dishes and exhibitions , to squid hats and parties , Parisians became fascinated by these unusual sea creatures , which at the time were still considered by many to be mythical . Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey where he spent 15 years of exile , Hugoâ s depiction of Manâ s battle with the sea and the horrible creatures lurking beneath its depths spawned an unusual fad in Paris : Squids . However , the novel was not as successful as his previous efforts , and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and Ã mile Zola , whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work . Though Hugoâ s popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication , many now consider Ninety-Three to be a work on par with Hugoâ s better-known novels . Hugo turned away from social\/political issues in his next novel , Les Travailleurs de la Mer -LRB- Toilers of the Sea -RRB- , published in 1866 .

However , paleotempestological research allows reconstruction of pre-historic hurricane activity trends on timescales of centuries to millennia . On the Atlantic coast , chance of landfalling hurricanes has doubled in the recent millennium compared to the one and a half millennia before . A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast . In fact , few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000 â `` 1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium ; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD , when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3 â `` 5 times . During the quiescent periods , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores Highâ '' controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillationâ '' was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean .

For example , the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything , so that no objectivity is possible , and falsely attributes to him a notion of abstraction whereby objects disappear until we are left with numbers as mere ghosts . Frege 's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass 's Berlin School , of which Husserl and Cantor can not be said to be orthodox representatives .

Moreover , objectivity is clearly defined in that work . Scholars such as J. N. Mohanty , Claire Ortiz Hill , and Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock , among others , have argued that Husserl 's so-called change from psychologism to platonism came about independently of Frege 's review .

In his professorial doctoral dissertation , On the Concept of Number -LRB- 1886 -RRB- and in his Philosophy of Arithmetic -LRB- 1891 -RRB- , Husserl sought , by employing Brentano 's descriptive psychology , to define the natural numbers in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of Weierstrass , Dedekind , Georg Cantor , Frege , and other contemporary mathematicians . Later , in the first volume of his Logical Investigations , the Prolegomena of Pure Logic , Husserl , while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics , also appears to reject much of his early work , although the forms of psychologism analyzed and refuted in the Prolegomena did not apply directly to his Philosophy of Arithmetic . Some analytic philosophers suggest that Husserl , after obtaining his PhD in mathematics , began analyzing the foundations of mathematics from a psychological point of view , as a disciple of Brentano . While some scholars point to Frege 's negative review of the Philosophy of Arithmetic , this did not turn Husserl towards Platonism , because he had already discovered the work of Bernhard Bolzano around 1890\/91 and explicitly mentioned Bolzano , Leibniz and Lotze as inspirations for his newer position .

If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession , the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road , where it is left till a neighbor , usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose , picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return ; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes . Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life , for if no suitor seeks her , she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price , an offer usually accepted , as the women are excellent agricultural laborers . Girls are betrothed at six or seven , and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood . The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows ; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment ; if a woman dies without bearing children , the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father , unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister . She is sent back to her parents , who have to return the marriage price , and pay a fine . The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy , endeavoring always to marry outside their clan . It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day .
